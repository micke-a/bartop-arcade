## Cabinet
Simple option of buying ready cut flatpack kit from eBay.
Bought from the seller [ell-s](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?item=156682869223&rt=nc&_ssn=ell-s) which sells a decently priced build with good reviews.

Reached out to and double-checked sizing with Rockstar print/arcade first regarding the cabinet sizing and got this reply.
```
Yes those sizes will be fine to order.
I will need the sizes for each of the panels either the 5 set or the 8 so max heights and widths for each please
```
Rockstar is the vinly provider that the ebay seller recommended


## Buttons
Cost £46

After having looked around all over the place and reading up on sticks and buttons, decided to start simple and
simply bought "EG STARTS 2 Player Arcade Buttons Arcade Contest DIY Retropie Cabinet Kit PC Game + LED Chrome Plating Arcade Buttons Mame Raspberry Pi Game Project" from Amazon

## Raspberry Pi
Have an old PI 4B at home, will start with this one.

### Software Install

First I tried the raspberry pi manager (https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), but recently they stopped providing the RetroPie as an image option.

So instead I downloaded the image from here https://retropie.org.uk/download/ .

Then used the raspberry pi manager to install the RetroPie image on an SD card.

Plugged the pi into a monitor and it started up just fine.


## Monitor
Planning to wait with buying this until I can properly measure the cabinet.

Cabinet accepts flat screen monitor Size, up to 56.4cm wide x 35.5cm high
(i.e. most 24" widescreen)
